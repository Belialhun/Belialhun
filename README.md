- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Belialhun
- This project is part of my toolset for Hungarian game translation, originally developed to support the fan localization of Soul Reaver 2.
- My goal is to provide technically robust, reusable, and user-friendly utilities for handling both text and graphical game assets.
- In addition to these tools, I also created a GUI-based file entropy analyzer, which is useful for inspecting the randomness or compression level of binary files.
